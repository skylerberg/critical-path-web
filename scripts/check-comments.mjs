// Two things written prose gets wrong, both of which a reader takes on trust.
//
//   pnpm run check:comments
//
// 1. The same rationale copied into two files. Whichever copy is not next to the
//    code that changes is the one that goes stale, and nothing points the editor
//    of one at the other. Fix by giving the rule a single owner — the module that
//    implements it — and cutting the copy down to what is local to its own site.
// 2. A file or symbol named in prose that no longer resolves, or that resolves
//    somewhere other than where the prose places it.
//
// Neither is a style rule. Both were found live: a `#sendOrFail` doc that
// miscounted its own call sites, and a comment placing a test helper in the
// directory next door to the one it is actually in.
//
// The markdown under DOCS is read the same way, because it makes the same two
// mistakes with none of the pressure that keeps a comment honest — nothing
// recompiles when a doc goes wrong. Both had drifted by the time this grew to
// cover them: a skill telling everyone to run the formatter the post-commit hook
// already runs, and a README describing a generator flag that had changed
// meaning.
//
// `--selftest` re-runs both checks against text that is deliberately wrong and
// fails if either reports clean. Run it after changing what they assert: a
// checker that has stopped matching anything reports the same green as a clean
// tree.
